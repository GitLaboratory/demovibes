Packages needed:
 lame libboost-dev libsamplerate-dev libicu-dev = demosauce
 libmad = pymad - must be installed manually - http://spacepants.org/src/pymad/

 pil (python imaging library) - check that libjpeg and libzlib is installed, otherwise you will miss jpeg / png support

Create python virtual environment:
 Install pip (python package install program)
 Install virtualenv (can use "pip install virtualenv" if you want)
 To ceate virtual env : pip install -E demovibesenv -U -r demovibes/contrib/requirements.txt
  - Note that it might fail on pymad - activate the environment, download and install that manually, then rerun the command
 To activate virt env : source demovibesenv/bin/activate
  - If pymad is yet not installed, download and install it.

Look over / change settings

web config:
 -directory /static/ -> to demovibes/static folder

  -Increase timeout for fastcgi to 500s at least.. (for event system)
