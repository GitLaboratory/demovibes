# About #

Demovibes is an all-in-one web radio streaming system built on a Python/Django framework. It was created as part of the Nectarine Demoscene Revival project. This project is part of the [Demovibes Collective](http://www.demovibes.org/).

### Simplified list of features ###

  * Allows multiple users to request songs, which are then played in order of request.
  * Supports streaming to Icecast servers using Ices0, so one or more relays can be configured easily.
  * Standard web portal features, including Profiles, Forums, Oneliner Chat, Private Messaging, Avatars, Notifications etc.
  * Music related features: Song Voting, Comments, Download Links, Favourites List, Song-Related BBCode Tags & More.
  * XML support for Songs, Compilations, Labels, Request History, Groups and more for greater 3rd party application support.
  * Users can upload new songs, create artist entries, groups and compilations.
  * AJAX Support.
  * Built on Python/Django framework, so is very robust and configurable.
